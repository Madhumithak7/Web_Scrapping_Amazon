I have watched a youtube channel "Alex the analyst" for learning how to use BeautifulSoup for webscrapping. This Mini-Project is replication of what I have learned for the video, I have used to different product to extract the data. I have tried to use BeautifulSoup to extract information about a product CeraVe Moisturising Cream from Amazon website and save it as a csv file. I have also added a feature of updaing the file every 24 hrs and send me mail if the product price get low than usual.
